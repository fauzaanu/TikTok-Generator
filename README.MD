# TIKTOK GENERATOR

This was a fork from https://github.com/gen1s/TikTok-Generator but I decided to re-implement it my own ideas of how a tiktok generator should look like

## Design Ideas

- Semi Automation
- Image generation should be better than grabbing reddit pics
- Initial repo was targeting quotes but lets make it dynamic for just any content

## INSTALLATION

- You need ImageMigick Installed : https://imagemagick.org/
- py -m virtualenv venv
- Windows: venv/scripts/activate
- Linux : source venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Your good to go âœ…

# CURRENT FEATURES

- âœ… color contrast - going for a popular text style on tiktok already!
- ðŸ¤” TBA : Image generation
- âœ… Word by word tiktok
- âœ… Dynamic now: add as many sentences as you like.

# USAGE

- run py main.py
- when prompted enter content and it will do the rest
- Slow speeds cannot be helped,
  to counter this speed disadvantage this tool is aiming to make the content look authentic and not like the rest of the automated generators
