# TIKTOK GENERATOR

This was a fork from https://github.com/gen1s/TikTok-Generator but I decided to re-implement it my own ideas of how a tiktok generator should look like

## Design Ideas

1. Not fully automation ✅

   Semi automation is the way. If something slips through me regarding the content in a video my account will be at risk.

2. Let the user choose the music ✅

   Video creation is a hassle. But finding a cool music is not. Its a fun part of the tiktok process. So lets do it manually.

3. Lets also ditch reddit. ✅

   Why should this very simple piece of python code rely on reddit api. We can use much better ways to get the images. Some ideas are to have a collection of images locally.

   We can also integrate this into an AI based service like midjourney. That would be so cool. But midjourney doesnt have an API but maybe there are other services that does.

4. Quotes? too main stream no? ✅

   Lets create the content ourselves. Lets ask the user what the content is instead looking up some quotes table

## INSTALLATION

- You need ImageMigick Installed
- do a requirements.txt
